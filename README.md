# Production Analysis

This project aims to optimize production efficiency at our customer's manufacturing by developing a Production Scheduling System that integrates with their existing ERP system. By analyzing production data, we can gain insights into bottlenecks, process timings, and variances, which will allow EMCC to minimize downtime and improve overall production performance.

## Objectives

The main objectives of the project include:

- Analyzing the production data to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
- Utilizing the analyzed data to build a Production Scheduling module that optimizes the scheduling of work orders.
- Delivering a user-friendly dashboard that visualizes key insights and supports informed decision-making.

## Project Requirements

- Access to customer production data.
- Align project deliverables with the timeline and client requirements.

## Deliverables

- **Production Scheduling Module:** A system for efficient scheduling based on machine availability, labor capacity, and material availability.
- **Data Analysis Report:** A comprehensive analysis report to support decision-making and resource optimization.
- **Power BI Dashboard:** A dashboard that visualizes key insights from the production data.

## Expected Outcomes

- Improved production efficiency and reduced downtime.
- Optimized resource allocation resulting in cost savings.
- Enhanced decision-making capabilities based on data-driven insights.
- Improved on-time delivery performance, leading to better customer satisfaction.

## Constraints/Risks

- Data quality issues, such as incomplete or inaccurate data, may affect the analysis.
- Changing project requirements may impact timelines.
- Data privacy and security concerns must be managed.
